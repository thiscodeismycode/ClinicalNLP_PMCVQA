Request for diagnosis. Suffering eczema and epompholyx at hands from the year of 2010.  It is attacking me recurrently.  Very painful.  Hope that physicians from all places could take a look.  Following is the history:-  Work History:  Graduated in June, 2009.  Start working after that.  Work requires contact with  hydrochloric acid with low concentration inside a trench.  It is used to clean the oxidized surface of metal.  There is no use of protective gloves durig the process, and has direct contact with the hydrochloric acid.  Both hands are involved in the physical work, have direct contact with industrial grease.  Change of work place in March 2010.  Working in the office there, with occasional contact with metal.  Not sure it is caused by allergy with metal.  Symptoms:  Blisters on the sides of both palms.  Very itchy.  If broken after scratching, liquid of light yellow in color is flowing out.  The more I scratch, the more is the itching.  Scab is forming after lesions.  Skin turns hard and starts shredding.  Mostly happening in Summer;  less serious in Winter.  Medical History: 1.  Diagnosis as eczema and epompholyx at the Dermatology Department of a local hospital.  Treatment is:  soaking in diluted Aluminum acetate solution, and topical use of Triamcinolone Acetonide Acetate and Miconazole Nitrate Neomycin Sulfate Cream.  No improvement after using them. 2. Soaking in salicylic acid solution by myself.  Effect is not obvious.  Have tried that 5 times. 3.  Topical use of Ketoconazole Ointment by myself.  Effect is not obvious. 4.  Diagnosis as epompholyx at a county level hospital. Treatment: Soaking in boric acid solution; oral use of Loratadine and XTR (Xiatare) tablets; Topical use of Urea ointment for one week.  After that change to another antifungal ointment which I don't recall the name. Also prescribed by the physician at the time is Compound Camphor Cream for use when itchy.  With all these, I don't feel itchy at all.  Even if I drink alcohol, the itchiness is still very minimal.  Unfortunately the problem comes back afte 6 months. 5. Soaking in Zuguang Powder+Pikangwang (A chinese herbal medicine containing Ketoconazole) every other night.  Yesterday was the 4 times.  The symptom is relieving a bit.  Skin is shredding, and becoming dry.  Topical use of Pikangwang is not very effective.  Each of the treatment and use of medications mentioned above is spaced at least 2 months apart.  I would be very grateful if you guys can offer any help.  The disease is so troublesome to me. I smoke, and not particularly fond of drinking alcohol (except when I accompany my boss on events).  I am fond of eating spicy food.  However, because of the problem on my hands, I have cut back most of it.  The pictures below are downloaded from the internet.  My situations are quite similar to them.  My skin is thicker, and the area of skin shredding is also bigger as well.  When the weather is warm, I can feel there are numerous blisters below the skin.
